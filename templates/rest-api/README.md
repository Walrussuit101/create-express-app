# create-express-app: rest-api 
This project was created using [create-express-app](https://github.com/Walrussuit101/create-express-app). :rocket:
# scripts
```sh
npm start
```
This will start the API on localhost at port 8080 (unless you provide a `PORT` environment variable)
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will re-start the API (using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)) on changes to any TypeScript or JSON file (hot-reloading)
